TinyMake version 0.03
=====================

TinyMake is a yet another perl based make tool. TinyMake's syntax for declaring 
targets, prerequisites and rules is relatively straightforward. A simple perl script using
TinyMake would look like this...

   use TinyMake
   file { sh "cat @changed >> $target" } "master.log" => ["app.log","system.log","user.log"];
   make "master.log"

In the above example the master.log file will only be updated if any of app.log, system.log or 
user.log are newer than master.log.
